		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Formerly known as <em>BALLS!</em> and successor to the UCL Tossers; for over twenty years, the Juggling &
			Circus Society has been providing a space for those wishing to practice juggling, flow arts, and other
			circus skills. Our regular sessions mix individual learning with workshops in an informal and friendly
			atmosphere.<br><br>

			Learn a skill that will last you for life! – or, if you end up outside Jobcentre because you do a fake
			humanities degree, a skill that will keep you alive. We currently teach juggling, unicycling, mini circus
			biking, poi, staff spinning, diabolo, hula hooping, and much more. We also hold monthly fire nights (pending
			risk assessment approval) where you will be able to try out your skills with extra consequences (fire),
			along with various meetups and plenty of social events!<br><br>

			All skill levels are welcome – whether you are looking for a space to practice cool circus tricks or want to
			learn a new skill to convince your ex that you are living your best life without them; join us in the North
			Cloisters every Tuesday 7-9pm for our regular sessions and at the Huntley's from 9-10pm for our social
			afterwards!

			<br><br>Join us today for just £5 via <a
				href="https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/juggling-and-circus-society">Students' Union UCL</a>.
			We're also on <a href="https://twitter.com/ucl_jacs">Twitter</a>, <a
				href="https://www.instagram.com/ucl_jacs/">Instagram</a>, and <a

		<h1>History</h1>

		<p> In the words of our predecessors, 'it's nice to record who was involved in the society and who we have to
			thank to for keeping it going', who then left the website to rot for the next 18 years. But it is true that
			we are incredibly lucky to have people who kept the society going for two whole decades.<br>

			<br>I've asked Lorik for a list of notable events for as far back as he can remember but there's still a
			nine-year gap between 2004-13; if you were a member of the society in those intervening years and would like
			to add to the list please let me know.
		</p>

		<h2>2022&#8211;23</h2>
		<p> We amended the constitution and renamed the primary committee positions. We also brought back Master of
			Balls. Nick Miao became Ringmaster (President), Madeline Lee became Master of Coins (Treasurer), and Marian
			Jango became Master of Wellbeing, Prosperity, and All That Is Good And Holy (Welfare Officer). We also
			(re)established our online presence by beefing the Union on Twitter over our fire juggling risk assessment.
			If we get it passed we'll do a 20th-anniversary fire show.</p>

		<h2>2021&#8211;22</h2>

		<p>We thought the society was dead as we initially had no president, but Gyen Ming offered to take over and the
			society was revived. Thank god for Gyen. Changed the session day from Mondays to Tuesdays.</p>

		<h2>2020&#8211;21</h2>

		<p>President: Justin Yim. No sessions as everything was over Zoom (and juggling over Zoom is difficult). Got to
			experience what a Welcome Fair is like over zoom (no one showed up).</p>

		<h2>2019&#8211;20</h2>

		<p>President: Justin Yim. Treasurer: Yuzhen (Rainy) Dong. Did well until March then everything closed because of
			Covid.</p>

		<h2>2018&#8211;19</h2>

		<p>President: Karen Serrano. Treasurer: Christopher Thong. Performed in the Bloomsbury Theatre as part of the
			Students' Union UCL Society Showcase. Did our first fire show in the UCL Main Quad.</p>

		<h2>2017&#8211;18</h2>

		<p> President: Lorik Bothwell. Treasurer: Karen Serrano. Had a social for the society's 15-year anniversary.
			Performed at the UCL Winter Arts festival.</p>

		<h2>2016&#8211;17</h2>

		<p>Nathan Waldie continued to be President. Daniel Chakrabarti is Treasurer. Did our first major show in a long
			time - UCLU Comedy Gala at the Shaw Theatre.</p>

		<h2>2015&#8211;16</h2>

		<p>Nathan Waldie became President. Known as the Dark Ages because we had very few members and were almost
			disaffiliated as a result.</p>

		<h2>2013&#8211;14</h2>

		<p>At some point between 2013-14 the committee changed the name from Balls! to Juggling and Circus Society.
			Apparently the old president wasn't too happy about the change and sent
			us an angry email.</p>

		<h2>2004&#8211;05</h2>

		<p>Patrick Nasralla became president and Emma-Jane Smith became Treasurer. Iain
			Murray carried on his casual webmaster role.</p>

		<h2>2003&#8211;04</h2>

		<p>Cameron Christie continued to be president, despite being in his final year.
			I think Alan and Judy were <em>supposed</em> to be helping. In the first term we
			performed in a London nightclub and at a student rally using glow balls and
			fire.</p>

		<h2>2002&#8211;03</h2>
		<p><em>BALLS!</em> was set up in 2002 by Cameron Christie with help from Alan
			Hewitt (and others?). Setting up <em>BALLS!</em> as an official society and
			finding a venue (Garage theatre) was a lot of work, for which we should be
			grateful. Despite being a small society in its first year, <em>BALLS!</em> put
			on a popular performance at the UCL union talent show.</p>

		<h2>Before <em>BALLS!</em></h2>

		<p>Apparently there used to be a society called the <em>UCL Tossers</em> during
			the 1990s. Juggling.org lists the contact as Ab Wilson and says they met in
			Carrol Marx Hall, Huntley Street. I'm sure there have been other UCL juggling
			meetings as well.</p>
